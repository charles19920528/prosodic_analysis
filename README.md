# prosodic_analysis

The repository is for the collaborators of the prosodic analysis project. For privacy reason, the data hasn't been released yet.
To use the code locally, first create a directory with name "data" under the content root directory and place the "processed_data.csv" file under the "data" directory. 
The first script to run is the data_preprocessing.py. After running the script, the user can start to use the functions in cluster.py and exploratory analysis.py to inspect the data.
